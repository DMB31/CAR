# Complete Guide 2025: Importing a Vehicle to Algeria with the CCR Consular Card
For Algerians residing abroad, the Certificate of Change of Residence (CCR) scheme offers a unique opportunity to import a vehicle free of customs duties and taxes upon a final return to Algeria. This guide summarizes the rules in force in 2025, based on recent legal texts and consular practices.

## Eligibility Conditions for the CCR Scheme
To benefit from the CCR, Algerian nationals must meet strict criteria:

### Administrative status:

- Be registered in the main register at an Algerian consulate for at least three years 16.
- Be over 19 years old 18.
- Have never benefited from the CCR before (for oneself or one's spouse) 13.

### Proof of residence:

- Provide proof of uninterrupted stay abroad for the last three years: salary slips (employees), internship or schooling certificates (students), or equivalent documents depending on the status 18.
- For single, widowed, or divorced women: a birth certificate with a specific mention is mandatory 1.

## Authorized Vehicles: Technical and Environmental Restrictions
The CCR only covers new vehicles, under certain conditions:

| Vehicle Type | Maximum Engine Capacity | Other Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gasoline | 1,800 cm³ | Purchase invoice dated < 1 year 18 |
| Diesel | 2,000 cm³ | Mileage ≤ 100 km 2 |
| Utility | GVW ≤ 5.95 tonnes | New only 1 |
| Two-wheelers | Subject to registration | Excludes quads/jet skis 1 |

### Exclusions:

- Used vehicles, even recent ones.
- Hybrid or electric engines are allowed but not exempt if they exceed the thresholds 57.
- Vehicles must meet Algerian safety standards (ABS, airbags, speed limiter) 7.

## Tax Exemptions and Value Ceilings
The CCR allows for a total exemption from customs duties and taxes, provided that the ceilings are respected:

- 10 million DA (∼€60,000) for workers, merchants, and retirees 13.
- 8 million DA (∼€48,000) for students and interns 1.

### Warning:

- Any excess in value or engine capacity will result in the application of the general customs regime 18.
- If the vehicle is resold before 3 years, the owner must repay all or part of the tax benefits:
  - 100% if sold < 12 months,
  - 66% between 12-24 months,
  - 33% between 24-36 months 47.

## Step-by-Step Procedure: From Application to Registration
### 1. Submission of the Preliminary File to the Consulate
#### Common documents:

- Handwritten request to the consul.
- Copy of the consular registration card + passport.
- Residence permit + proof of address.
- Sworn statement of not having previously benefited from the CCR 18.
- Specific documents depending on the status (e.g., pay slips for employees, Pôle Emploi certificate for the unemployed) 8.

→ Processing time: 15 days after submission 1.

### 2. Purchase of the Vehicle and Supplementary File
Purchase the vehicle only after consular approval 13.

#### Documents to be provided for customs clearance:

- Original invoice of the vehicle.
- European Certificate of Conformity (COC).
- Provisional registration card (with Algerian address) 68.

### 3. Customs Clearance and Registration in Algeria

**Registration:** Obtain the Algerian registration card through local services.
