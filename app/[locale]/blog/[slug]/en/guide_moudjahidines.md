## Complete 2025 Guide: The Moudjahidine License for Vehicle Imports

The "Moudjahidine license" regime is a specific system that grants significant tax advantages for importing vehicles into Algeria. It is intended to honor the veterans of the national liberation war and their dependents.

This guide clarifies the conditions, benefits, limitations, and procedures to benefit from this exceptional regime in 2025.

### 1. The Main Advantage: Total Exemption

The major privilege granted by the Moudjahidine license is a **total exemption from all customs duties and taxes** when importing a passenger vehicle.

This means the beneficiary pays no customs duties, no VAT, and no other normally applicable taxes (TCS, etc.), which represents a very substantial saving on the final cost of the vehicle.

### 2. Who are the Beneficiaries?

The right to this license is strictly reserved for the following categories:
-   **Moudjahidines** (veterans of the national liberation war).
-   **War invalids** of the national liberation war with a disability rate of 60% or more.
-   **Widows and children of Chouhada** (martyrs of the war).
-   **Widows of Moudjahidines** and war invalids, under certain conditions.

### 3. Conditions and Limitations to Respect

Even though the regime is very advantageous, it is framed by strict rules to prevent abuse.

#### Import Frequency
The beneficiary can only use this right **once every five (5) years**. This period is non-negotiable.

#### Engine Capacity Limitations
Ceilings on engine capacity are imposed for vehicles imported under this regime:
-   **Gasoline Engine:** Capacity less than or equal to **1800 cm³**.
-   **Diesel Engine:** Capacity less than or equal to **2000 cm³**.

> **Note:** Unlike the regime for individuals, the import of diesel vehicles is authorized under the Moudjahidine license, within the fixed engine capacity limit.

#### Non-Transferability Clause (Inalienability)
The vehicle imported under this regime is subject to a non-transferability clause. It cannot be sold, transferred, or have its ownership changed for a period of **three (3) to five (5) years**, depending on the case, except in cases of force majeure and with the authorization of the customs services.

### 4. Specific Documents Required

In addition to the standard documents (invoice, registration certificate, etc.), the file must imperatively contain the documents justifying the beneficiary's status:
-   A valid **Moudjahid card, dependent's card, or disability certificate**.
-   An **attestation of non-benefit from an import under this regime** during the last five years, issued by the competent authorities.
-   A sworn declaration stating that the vehicle is for personal use.

### Conclusion

The Moudjahidine license is a recognition from the nation to its veterans and their families, offering them the possibility to import a vehicle without any tax burden. However, it is crucial to strictly adhere to the conditions of frequency, engine capacity, and non-resale to comply with the regulations.
