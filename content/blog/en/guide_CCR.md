## Complete 2025 Guide: Vehicle Import via Certificate of Change of Residence (CCR)

The Certificate of Change of Residence (CCR) is a government scheme that allows Algerian nationals permanently returning to the country to benefit from significant customs advantages on vehicle imports.

This guide, updated for 2025, details the rigorous conditions, tax benefits, limitations, and procedure to follow to successfully complete your import project.

### 1. What is the CCR and what are its benefits?

The CCR is a document issued by the Algerian consulate in your country of residence, attesting to your permanent return to Algeria. Its main advantage is allowing the customs clearance of a **new** passenger vehicle with a **very significant reduction on customs duties and taxes**.

This reduction can range from partial to total exemption depending on the vehicle's engine capacity, representing considerable savings.

### 2. Eligibility Conditions: Who can benefit?

The criteria to obtain a CCR are strict and cumulative:
-   **Nationality:** Must be an Algerian national.
-   **Age:** Must be over 19 years old.
-   **Consular Registration:** Must have been registered with the Algerian consulate of your place of residence for **at least three (3) uninterrupted years**.
-   **History:** Must have **never** previously benefited from a CCR. This is a one-time right.
-   **Stay Abroad:** Must justify an effective and uninterrupted stay abroad of at least three years at the time of application.

### 3. The Vehicle: Limitations and Constraints

The choice of vehicle is also highly regulated.

#### Vehicle Condition
The vehicle must be **new** and **never previously registered**, either in the country of purchase or elsewhere.

#### Engine Capacity Limitations
Engine capacity ceilings are in place:
-   **Gasoline or Hybrid Engine:** ≤ 1800 cm³.
-   **Diesel Engine:** ≤ 2000 cm³.

> **Warning:** Any vehicle exceeding these capacities will be refused customs clearance under the CCR scheme.

#### Value Cap
The value of the vehicle (purchase price on the invoice) **must not exceed a certain amount** set by the current regulations (consult the consulate for the exact value at the time of purchase).

### 4. Procedure and Required Documents

The CCR application is made **before the final return** to Algeria, at your consulate.

#### Documents to provide (non-exhaustive list):
1.  **CCR application form** provided by the consulate.
2.  **Original and valid consular registration card**.
3.  **Algerian passport** and residence permit of the country of residence.
4.  **Proof of residence for the last three years** (employment contracts, pay slips, rent receipts, etc.). The type of document depends on your status (employee, student, retiree...).
5.  **Sworn statement** of never having benefited from a CCR.
6.  **Pro-forma or final purchase invoice** for the new vehicle, clearly stating the technical specifications.

> **Crucial advice:** Do not purchase the vehicle until you have obtained a-principled approval from the consulate. Once the CCR is obtained, it is valid for **six (6) months** to carry out customs clearance in Algeria.

### 5. Inalienability of the Vehicle

The vehicle imported under the CCR scheme is non-transferable. It cannot be sold or transferred for a period determined by law, generally of **three (3) years**.

### Conclusion

The CCR is a boon for Algerians returning to the country, but obtaining it is conditional on strict adherence to rigorous criteria. The key to success lies in anticipating the procedures and compiling a flawless application file at your consulate.
