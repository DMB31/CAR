## Complete 2025 Guide: Importing a Vehicle Under 3 Years Old in Algeria as an Individual

The import of vehicles under 3 years old by resident individuals in Algeria is once again authorized, a long-awaited decision that opens up new prospects for many Algerians. However, this procedure is governed by strict regulations that are essential to master to carry out one's project successfully.

This detailed guide, updated with the most recent information for 2025, explains all the steps, conditions, and applicable taxes to import your car legally and with peace of mind.

### 1. Who Can Import and How Often?

The right to import a used vehicle is granted to **any resident individual in Algeria**. The main condition is a frequency limitation: you can only perform this operation **once every three (3) years**.

The payment for the vehicle must be made from your **own foreign currency funds**, which must be held in a foreign currency account in Algeria.

### 2. What Types of Vehicles Are Allowed?

The regulations are specific regarding the age and engine type of the vehicles.

#### Vehicle Age
The vehicle must be **less than 3 years old** at the time of customs clearance. This age is calculated from the date of its first registration abroad, as mentioned on the registration certificate.

#### Authorized Engine Types
You can import the following types of vehicles:
-   **Gasoline**
-   **Hybrid (Gasoline/Electric)**
-   **Electric**

> **Major point of caution:** The import of vehicles with a **Diesel engine is strictly forbidden** under this scheme.

### 3. Customs Clearance: Calculation of Taxes and Duties

This is the most technical step, but the Finance Law has introduced a very advantageous preferential tax regime.

#### Basis of Calculation
Taxes are calculated on the **CIF value** of the vehicle (Cost, Insurance, Freight), i.e., its purchase price plus transport and insurance costs to the Algerian port. If the customs administration deems the declared value too low, it can reassess it based on reference schedules (like the Argus).

#### Reductions on Duties and Taxes
The main advantage of this scheme lies in the tax reductions granted based on engine type and displacement:
-   **Electric vehicle:** An exceptional reduction of **80%** on the total amount of duties and taxes.
-   **Gasoline or hybrid vehicle (displacement ≤ 1800 cm³):** A reduction of **50%**.
-   **Gasoline or hybrid vehicle (displacement > 1800 cm³):** A reduction of **20%**.

### 4. Essential Documents

The meticulous preparation of your file is the key to smooth customs clearance. Here are the documents to provide:
-   **Original purchase invoice** for the vehicle.
-   **Original registration certificate** from the country of origin (car registration document).
-   **Certificate of conformity** issued by the manufacturer or an authorized representative.
-   A favorable **technical inspection report** less than 3 months old, issued in the country of origin, attesting to the vehicle's good general condition.
-   A certified translation of the documents if they are not in French or Arabic.

### 5. Is There a Resale Limitation?

To combat speculation, a non-transferability clause is applied. The vehicle imported under this framework cannot be resold before a period of **three (3) years** from the date of its registration in Algeria.

Importing a vehicle under 3 years old is a real opportunity for individuals in Algeria. By scrupulously respecting the conditions (frequency, engine type, age) and by carefully preparing your file, you can bring your project to fruition while benefiting from significant tax advantages.
